# Insurance-analysis-python
Description

This is a dataset from a bank in the United States. Besides usual services, this bank also provides car 
insurance services. The bank organizes regular campaigns to attract new clients. The bank has potential 
customers’ data, and bank’s employees call them for advertising available car insurance options. We are 
provided with general information about clients (age, job, etc.) as well as more specific information about the 
current insurance sell campaign (communication, last contact day) and previous campaigns (attributes like 
previous attempts, outcome). 
You have data about 4000 customers who were contacted during the last campaign and for whom the results 
of campaign (did the customer buy insurance or not) are known.
Classification Task
The task is to predict for 1000 customers who were contacted during the current campaign, whether they will 
buy car insurance or not.
